I am currently a fourth-year PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/) at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). 

Before joining HKUST, I received my Bachelor's degree from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). 

When not buried in coding or solving complex equations, I love staying active and exploring new hobbies. I love playing tennis, swimming, or hitting the gym. I also enjoy reading books, watching movies and travelling to new places - there's nothing like immersing yourself in a new culture and meeting new people!
